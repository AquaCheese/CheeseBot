## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Goal not auto-updating?**
- Auto-tracking only works for boosts and members
- Other goal types require manual updates with `/goal update`

**Can't see celebrations?**
- Bot needs "Send Messages" permission in announcement channels
- Celebrations go to system channel or general channels

**Goal not showing in view?**
- Deleted goals are marked inactive, not removed
- Use correct goal ID numbers
- Check if goal was deleted by another admin

**Progress bar looks wrong?**
- Progress is capped at 100% visually
- Over-achievement is tracked but displayed as 100%
